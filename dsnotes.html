        </div>
        <p>To understand Data Structure we need to understand some basics. so let's get started.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What is DATA?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The <b>quantities</b>, <b>Character</b> or <b>Symbols</b> on which operation are performed by a computer, by which may be stored and transmitted in the form of electrical signals and recorded on magnetic, optical or machanical recording media.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>EXAMPLE:  C=a+b</b>  (Here a and b is data)
        </p>
        <h2>
            WHAT IS INFORMATION?
        </h2>
        <p>
            When the Data is processed and has a meaning then it is known as <b>INFORMATION</b>.<br><b>EXAMPLE: <br>DATA</b> - TIPRA SI EMAN YM (only a data which means that data stored in memory may have an unordered and unorganized manner).<br><b>INFORMATION</b> - MY NAME IS ARPIT (After arrangement it becomes an information).
        </p>
        <p>
            Now it's time to learn about DATA STRUCTURE.So,
        </p>
        <h2>
            WHAT IS A DATA STRUCTURE?
        </h2>
        <p>
            A <b>DATA STRUCTURE</b> is the systematic way to organize data so that it can be used effectively.<br>
            <b>EXAMPLE:</b>-  Arrays
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Instead of creating <b>MULTIPLE VARIABLES</b> of same type. Why not creat an array to store all the values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Storing strings is equelent of storing a sequence of the characters. this requires an <b>Array</b>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>
            WHY DO WE NEED DATA STRUCTURE?
        </h3>
        <p>
            As we know that it is very imortant to store the data in systematic and organized way. There are various such example like,<br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Stack Data Structure</b> is used in Implementing <b>REDO</b> and <b>UNDO</b> Features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <B>ARRAY DATA STRUCTURE</b> is used to store an <B>IMAGE</b> as a <B>BITMAP</b>.
                        <p>
                            <b>BITMAP IMAGES </b>are stored as a series of tiny dots called <b>PIXELS</b>. The small square is assigned with a color and then arranged in apattern to form an IMAGE.
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Storing the Friendship Information on a Social Networking Sites by using <b>GRAPH</b>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Now it's time to lean about ADT. "hey, what is this ADT." wait buddy you will lean it soon, but befor it let's learn some basics.
        </p>
        <h2>
            WHAT IS DATA TYPE?
        </h2>
        <P>
            Data Type is noting but setting the <b>DOMAIN </b>of the value. Data type not sets the Domain, it also Define the <b>ALLOWED OPERATIONS</b> on those values.<br>
            <b>EXAMPLE :-</b> <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>INT TYPE:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Takes only only Integer Values.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>OPERATIONS:- </b> Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, Bitwise operations etc.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>FLOAT TYPE: </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Takes only Floating point Values.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>OPERATIONS:- </b> Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, Division etc(Bitwise and % operations are mot allowed).

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </P>
        <h2>
            USER DEFINED DATA TYPES
        </h2>
        <P>
            The Operations and Values of USER DEFINED datatype are not specified in the language itself but is specified by USER.<br>
            <b>EXAMPLE: </b>by using Structure, we are defining our own type by combining other data types.
            <br><br><b>
                struct point{<br>int x;<br>int y;<br>}
            </b>
        </P>
        <h2>
            ABSTRSCT DATA TYPES(ADT)
        </h2>
        <P>ADTs are like user define data types which defines opeartions on values using function without specifying what is there inside the functuion and how operations are performed.
        </P>
        <P>
            ADT provides <b>ABTRACTION.</b> Which means hiding the backend details from the user.<br>
            <b>EXAMPLE:- </b><br><ul>
            <li><b>STACK ADT:</b><br></li>
            A Stack consists of element of the same type arrangement in a sequential order. 
        </ul>
        </P>
        <h2>
            ADVANTAGES OF ADT:
        </h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Let say, if someone wants to use the stack in the program, then he can simply use <b>PUSH</b> and <b>POP</b> operations without konwing its implementation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also, if in future, the implementation of stack is changed form array or linked list, then client program will work the same way without being affected.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
